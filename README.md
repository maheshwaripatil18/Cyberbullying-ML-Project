# Cyber Bullying Detection on Social Media using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Cyberbullying has become a major concern with the rapid growth of social media platforms. Harmful online activities such as hate speech, personal attacks, and abusive comments can negatively impact users' mental health and digital safety.

This project implements a **Machine Learning based Cyberbullying Detection System** that automatically identifies offensive and abusive content from social media text using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and classification algorithms.

The system analyzes user-generated text, extracts meaningful features, and predicts whether the content contains cyberbullying behavior.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses two different datasets:

### 1. Twitter Hate Speech Dataset

* Contains tweets with offensive and hateful language
* Used for detecting explicit cyberbullying patterns

### 2. Wikipedia Personal Attack Dataset

* Contains user comments with personal attacks
* Used for detecting subtle abusive behavior

---

## 🔍 NLP Techniques Used

### Text Preprocessing

* Text cleaning
* Tokenization
* Stop word removal
* Text normalization

### Feature Extraction

#### Bag of Words (BoW)

Converts text into numerical word frequency vectors.

#### TF-IDF

Measures the importance of words based on their frequency in documents.

#### Word2Vec Embeddings

Captures semantic relationships between words.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms

### AdaBoost

Used to improve classification performance by combining multiple weak learners.

### Multinomial Naive Bayes

Used for text classification based on word probability distribution.

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Efficient classifier suitable for large text datasets.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Used for sentiment analysis and classification of emotional tone.
